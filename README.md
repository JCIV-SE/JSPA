# JSPA

### Most Recent Work
- Refactored the backend to a better project structure
- Added environmental variables, three different kinds of DBs to connect to: dev, test, prod
- Renamed DB models to follow conventions


### Possible Next Steps
- Get front-end rendering into something semi-usable
- Delete unused deps & update ones I'm relying on
- Refactor the back-end into an Apollo GraphQL backend
- Possibly change DB services to AWS
- Going to NEED to ideate the UX -- consider crowd-sourcing the design, asking alumni for opinions
- Refactor front-end to use React-Router, Redux, Immutable best practices
- If I'm continuing with Material UI, then maybe consider doing a similar wrapper & default styling to my BOD project
- I have "Metrics" models for my database, but I think some basic ML using Tensorflow is possible - might be a good chance to practice Python on the back-end
